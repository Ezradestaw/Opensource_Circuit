# Python Circuit Simulator

A Python-based open-source circuit simulator designed for students who want to **practice and experiment with electrical circuits** without access to expensive laboratory equipment.  

This project combines my knowledge of electrical engineering, Python programming, and mathematics to create a tool that allows users to **simulate, analyze, and visualize circuits**.

## 🎯 Purpose

As a student of electrical engineering, I realized that:  
- Circuit courses often lack access to practical labs.  
- Online simulators are expensive and unaffordable for many students.  

This simulator was created to **fill that gap**, providing a free, open-source tool for learning and experimenting with circuits.

## ⚡ Features

- Simulate basic analog circuits:  
  - Voltage Divider  
  - RC Low-Pass / High-Pass Filter  
  - RLC Circuits (future updates)  
- Calculate voltages, currents, and basic signal responses.  
- Visualize output using **graphs and plots**.  
- Easy-to-use **command-line interface (CLI)** for inputting circuit parameters.  
- Open-source and free for students and hobbyists.
