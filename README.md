#  Python Circuit Simulator

**“As students, we have the solutions for our problems!”**  

Welcome! I’m **Ezra Destaw**, and I created this Python Circuit Simulator to help students like us explore and experiment with electrical circuits — even when access to physical laboratories or expensive software is limited.

## Why I Created This

While studying **Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering Circuits** by Sadiku, I realized something:  
- I didn’t have access to a proper laboratory.  
- Commercial software for circuit simulation was often **expensive and unaffordable for students**.  

So, I decided to **apply my Python knowledge** to develop an **open-source solution** that students can use freely. This project is my way of saying:  
> “We, students, can build our own tools and solutions!”  

If you are a student, hobbyist, or developer interested in electrical engineering, I invite you to **participate, contribute, and improve this project**.

##  Features

This simulator supports:

- **Ohm’s Law** – Calculate current, voltage, and resistance.  
- **Kirchhoff’s Laws** – Apply KCL and KVL to circuits.  
- **Thevenin & Norton Theorems** – Find equivalent circuits.  
- **Source Transformation** – Convert voltage sources to current sources and vice versa.  
- **Transient Analysis** – Simulate capacitor and inductor behavior over time.  
- **AC Circuit Analysis** – Plot and simulate different AC waveforms (sinusoidal, square, triangular).  
- **Voltage & Current Division** – Explore how voltage and current distribute in a circuit.
