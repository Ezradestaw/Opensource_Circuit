# 🔌 Open-Source Circuit Simulator (Python)

A **free, secure, and open-source circuit simulator** built with Python for  
**Students interested in technology and computing**.

This project was created to make circuit simulation accessible to everyone — especially students who don’t have access to physical laboratories or expensive online software.

---

##  Project Vision

I started this project after:

- Mastering **Python**
- Studying *“Fundamentals of Electric Circuits” by Alexander & Sadiku*
- Realizing that:
  - I had **no access to a physical electronics lab**
  - Most online simulators and tools are **too expensive**
  - Many students in Ethiopia and around the world face the same problem

So I decided to build a **free, open, and secure simulator** that anyone can use, study, and improve.
